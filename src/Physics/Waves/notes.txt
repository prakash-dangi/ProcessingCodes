General equation of a wave, describing its displacement over time and position is
y(x, t) = Asin(kx - wt + phi).

lets first generate snapshots of the waves at different time instants.

this contains the details about the wave sourse and wave itself.
    1. its frequency given by k and w.
    2. its phase phi.
    3. its amplitude.
